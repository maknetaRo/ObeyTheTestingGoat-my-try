## Useful Commands and Concepts

- Running the Django dev server
  `python manage.py runserver`

- Running the functional tests
  `python functional_tests.py`

- Running the unit tests
  `python manage.py test`

- The unit-test/code cycle

1. Run the unit tests in the terminal.

2. Make a minimal code change in the editor.

3. Repeat!

* Good Unit testing practice says that each test should only test one thing.

## Useful TDD Concepts

#### Regression

When new code breaks some aspect of the application which used to work.

#### Unexpected failure

When a test fails in a way we weren’t expecting. This either means that we’ve made a mistake in our tests, or that the tests have helped us find a regression, and we need to fix something in our code.

#### Red/Green/Refactor

Another way of describing the TDD process. Write a test and see it fail (Red), write some code to get it to pass (Green), then Refactor to improve the implementation.

#### Triangulation

Adding a test case with a new specific example for some existing code, to justify generalising the implementation (which may be a "cheat" until that point).

#### Three strikes and refactor

A rule of thumb for when to remove duplication from code. When two pieces of code look very similar, it often pays to wait until you see a third use case, so that you’re more sure about what part of the code really is the common, re-usable part to refactor out.

#### The scratchpad to-do list

A place to write down things that occur to us as we’re coding, so that we can finish up what we’re doing and come back to them later.

- delet the databese and re-create fresh
  `rm db.sqlite3`
  `python manage.py migrate --noinput`
